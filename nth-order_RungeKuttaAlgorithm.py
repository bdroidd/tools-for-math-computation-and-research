#   This example is of a second-order linear differential equation of non-constant coefficients. 
#   The program prompts the user for the coefficients of the function. The interval of integration
#   is predetermined and the differential equation exists along the set of real numbers ‚Äî in this 
#   case, R¬≤. The numerical method implemented may be generalized to a higher-order differential 
#   equation, for an arbitrary n-value.
